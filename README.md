## About This Course

How do you make code that moves like wind, flocks like birds, or grows like a tree? Not by drawing each frame, but by writing rules and letting the system run.

This course adapts Daniel Shiffman's [The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com) for C++ using [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc). We explore how to simulate natural systems through code—building programs that behave, respond, and sometimes surprise us.
